    <h1 class="entry-title">About</h1>
    
    <p>Our mission statement:</p>
<p>Cleveland PyLadies is an open and inclusive Python user group
explicitly focused on engaging women and underrepresented populations in tech,
specifically in and around Northeast Ohio. We are a local chapter of the global
Pyladies organization.</p>
<p>PyLadies is an inclusive community centered around
the Python programming language. Our focus is on promoting diversity,
growth, and camaraderie in that space.
Whether you're new to programming or deep into
your coding career, there's room for you in Cleveland PyLadies.</p>
<p>Our commitment to remote participation:</p>
<p>We understand that work schedules, motherhood, transportation,
and many other factors can act as a barrier for many women
that otherwise would love to engage with local tech communities.
Because of this, we aim to stream ~30 minute chunks of our meetups
to facilitate participation of PyLadies that are not able to make
a meeting in person.</p>

Many of our members are new to Python, so we curate playlists of educational videos and tutorials.</p>
<p><a aria-label="PyLadies Global" href="http://www.pyladies.com">PyLadies Global</a> mission statement:</p>
<p>PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping
more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community.
Our mission is to promote, educate, and advance a diverse Python community through
outreach, education, conferences, and social gatherings.
PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and
a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate!</p>
<p><a aria-label="PyLadies Code of Conduct" href="http://www.pyladies.com/CodeOfConduct/">PyLadies Global Code of Conduct</a></p>
<p>Pyladies is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This does not only extend to members to local PyLadies communities, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger PyLadies community of users, developers and integrators through events or interactions.</p>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, IRC chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any PyLadies event, or expulsion from mailing lists, IRC chats, discussion boards and other electronic communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from PyLadies Meetup group membership.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from any member of the PyLadies community, IRC chat admins, website admins, or organizers/representatives of any physical events put on under the auspices of PyLadies.</p>
